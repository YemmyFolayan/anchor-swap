# Welcome

Congrats, you've made it to the coding challenge! We're impressed with what we've seen from you so far.

## The challenge

1. Display a basic understanding of cross program invocation on mainnet, by interacting with the Jupiter program on chain. We want to see you build a single transaction on any AMM using jupiter's CPI program.

2. Run a single flash loan on devnet, (using Solend, or any other tool). Here is a very straightforward example.

3. Basic readme on how to run each step of your project, including anchor deployment for the first program, and .env file (wallets, etc) if relevant for either. 

## First, time estimates

Before you get started, the first task is an essential, and oft overlooked important and difficult quality of advanced engineering. Spend some preliminary drawing board time, even if just a few minutes, to break this assessment into smaller pieces, and estimate how long each will take you. Commit a CSV with that information as your first commit. Time yourself while working, and update this file as time goes on, with a new column showing logged time so it can be compared to the initial guess. We are looking at your process, and promise we will not be phased by poor estimates. See the sample time estimate CSV from a previous challenge attached. 

## Assessment

How will we be assessing you?

-The approach. We want to see how familliar you are with Solana, but also how you think about these problems, and what you do if you happen get stuck. Which brings us to: 

-Communication! You are free to ask us for help if you don't understand a topic or a term, and you can also bounce ideas at any step in the process, as if we were working on a team but this was your task to accomplish.  

-Results. Something that works. 

-Readability and extensibility. How readable is your work, and how easily can someone else pick it up and extend on it? 

# Happy hacking!
